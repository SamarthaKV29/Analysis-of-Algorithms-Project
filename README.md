# Analysis-of-Algorithms-Project
The project created to test the time taken on large data sets for sorting algorithms


The main code is in the InesrtionSortAnalysis File. This program takes as input:
1. T(n) number of elements
2. step size

and outputs:
data.txt - with values of time taken for the iterations in each step. Basically by increasing the number of elements, we check the increase per step size.

Can be used to graph the data, 

Inside, I also have included a random number generator. One should be able to try different algoithms without modifying too much.
